# Sudoku-Solver
The program uses recursion to solve different Sudoku puzzles, making recursive calls on every cell. There is a print( ) method useful for debugging purposes. It prints a character based representation of the current state of the solution on standard output. Set the DEBUG constant to true to turn this code on. There are three example puzzle files provided: puzzle1.txt, puzzle2.txt and badpuzzle.txt. The first two have solutions, the last one does not.
